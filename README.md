This project explores two different approaches to solve the modified Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), where each city has a specific iteration requirement to be visited. The modified TSP is tackled using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Brute Force algorithms.

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) Algorithm
The ACO algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the foraging behavior of ants. In this modified version of the TSP, the problem involves finding the optimal route for a salesman to visit a set of cities, with each city requiring a certain number of iterations to be unlocked. The objective is to minimize the total time taken to visit all cities while respecting the constraints.

Brute Force Algorithm
The Brute Force algorithm explores all possible permutations of city visits to find the optimal route. While computationally expensive, it serves as a benchmark for comparison with more efficient algorithms like ACO
